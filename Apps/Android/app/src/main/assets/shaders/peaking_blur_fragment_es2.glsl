#version 100

// Pass 1 of 3 of focus peaking: the VERTICAL half of the separable re-blur, once per
// source pixel. One texel carries both rows the operator's 2x2 quad needs —
// RG = the blur centred on this row, BA = the blur centred on the row below — each
// packed to 16 bits.
//
// Why this pass exists at all. The detector's re-blur is separable, but writing it fused
// costs a full 8x8 neighbourhood per pixel (64 taps) because the operator wants the
// blurred value at four positions, not one. Split, the vertical half is 8 taps here and
// the horizontal half is 8 reads in `peaking_mask_fragment_es2.glsl` — 20 taps against 68
// for an identical result. That is the difference between peaking running and not running
// on a floor device: a Mali-G52 at 1024x768 source needs ~2.7 GTexel/s for the fused form
// against roughly 1 available, which presents as a feed that flickers and stops updating.
//
// SPLIT, NOT APPROXIMATED. `Peaking.reblurWeights` sum to exactly 1, and the weight
// function is zero beyond |offset| >= 3.5, so the two vertical blurs this writes are the
// same `vp0`/`vp1` the fused loop accumulated — see the header of the mask pass for the
// algebra. No constant here is new; every one is transcribed from `Peaking` in shared core.
//
// 16-BIT PACKING IS LOAD-BEARING, not caution. The coarse operator takes DIFFERENCES of
// these blurred values, and a blurred field is smooth by construction, so the differences
// are small — an 8-bit intermediate quantises them at 1/255 and swamps the very gradient
// the ratio divides by. Packed, the error is ~1/65025 and lands far below the noise gate.
// A half-float target would be cleaner but throws on an ES2 context, and on the live
// surface that throw tears down the whole GPU path.
